# My First Neural Network
This project consists of small deep learning projects that I did before I started my degree. The concept of AI has always been somewthing I was intrigued by and,
even though fairly small, being able to conduct a project under this has helped me a lot on my general perspective on the industry.

This project includes one introduction level DL algorithm and one a bit more complex and **interactive** network.

## Initial neural network 

This particular algorithm has 100.000 revolution throughout its training and in each part the model's weights are either rewarded or punished by using comparison 
between calculated output value and the actual training output.


## Improved and interactive neural network with premade model

- This is an implementation of a 3-layer Neural Network. The network is again initialized with random weights and then trained on 4 input-output samples to adjust 
the synaptic weights.

- The training process continues for 10.000 iterations. After the training the user can input 3 values and network returns a confidance rate between 0 and 1.
